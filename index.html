           <p>In this paper, I write
Deep thoughts filled my mind.
I'm making this poem 
For the girl I love.
With her smile so bright
I mistaken it for a sunlight.
Her face is so beautiful
Even Venus got jealous.
And her gorgeous eyes
It can even outshine the starry night.
My love for her is so great
It's eight times the sun's weight.
She taught me the greatest thing
And that is how to love. 
Goes with any style
Even in simple clothes, you shine
Overflowing with love
Right here is my heart
Giggling and smiling 
Over your pretty picture 
Unconditional love is all I can give
Star of my eyes, you're my eternal light I'll never stop loving you
Not because you love me
I will keep going
Because I don't want to regret
If I let you go.You don't have to do anything
To be perfect
Just you existing
Is more than enough for me Here's a little note
For my angel
You're doing just fine
You don't have to worry
About anything Infinity wasn't just about numbers
Sometimes
It's my love for you.Just hold my hands
And we'll face everything together.Flying in my stomach
Hits me like a truck
Harder than a thunderstruck
She's my source of luck

The way her eyes bloom
It makes my heart boom
Her bright smiles and puffy cheeks
She is all I seeks

Hairs swaying like waves
To her I'm a slave
To heaven I'm ascending
She's my everything

Apple of my eye
The reason I cry
The reason I feel sky-high
She is my whole life "Gusto kita"
Nagtapat ako ng aking nadarama.
Di ko alam kung kailan o pano nagsimula.
Hindi ko rin alam kung saan magsisimula.
Akala ko kasi ay agad itong mawawala.
Ngunit hindi pala.
Kasi minahal na kita.
Hanggang sa nagtapat ka na ako'y gusto mo din pala.
Ngayon gusto na kitang makasama.
Gusto kong mahawakan ang kamay mo na sa akin ay nagpapaklma.
Matitigan ang mata mo na kumikislap kapag may liwanag na tumatama.
Nais kong paulit ulit na sabihin sayo yung salita na...
"Gusto kita" In this paper, I write
Deep thoughts of my heart,
For the girl I love so much,
Whose beauty sets my world apart.

Her smile is like the sun,
So warm and shining bright,
And her face is like a work of art,
That even Venus couldn't replicate.

Her eyes, like stars in the night,
Shine bright and mesmerize,
And my love for her is so great,
It weighs more than the sun in the skies.

She taught me the greatest lesson,
The art of love and how to give,
And for that, I'll always be grateful,
As long as I have her, I'll truly live.In simple garb you radiate,
A love that simply overflows,
My heart belongs to you alone,
With laughter and a smile that glows.

Your beauty takes my breath away,
As I gaze upon your face,
Unconditional love I give,
You're the star that guides my pace.

My eyes behold your radiant light,
Eternal, forever bright,
You're the one for whom I live,
My love for you will never blight My love for you will never cease
Not just because you feel the same
But because to let you go, I fear
Would be a regret I couldn't sustain

I'll hold on tight, with all my might
And love you till the end of time
For the thought of losing you
Brings a fear that's hard to climb

You've become a part of me
A love so deep, it's hard to explain
But know that I'll never stop loving you
Till the end of my days remain.A longing in my heart
Echoes like a drum
Each beat igniting a spark
Of desire, burning like a sun

Her beauty, a work of art
Eyes that shine, a work of magic
Her smile, like a rose, it does impart
Happiness and joy, making me manic

Her hair, like a field of wheat
Blowing in the wind, such a sight
I'm drawn to her, like a moth to heat
She's my guiding light, my guiding light

She's the apple of my eye
The love of my life, my reason why
I'll cherish and treasure her
Until the end of time, forevermore.Endless and boundless,
My love for you does run,
Like the infinite digits of pi,
It has no end, no sum.

Like the never-ending horizon,
My affection for you will never cease,
Like the vast expanse of the universe,
My love for you will never decrease.

Infinity is not just a number,
It's a feeling that's hard to define,
But when it comes to my love for you,
Infinity is the perfect sign.

With every beat of my heart,
I know that my love for you will never end,
Just like the concept of infinity,
It will only continue to expand.Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
But my love for you,
Is deeper than any hue.

Like the starry sky at night,
It shines so bright and true,
Just like the love I feel for you,
Forever strong, forever new.

From the bottom of my heart,
My feelings for you do start,
Like a garden in full bloom,
My love for you will never resume.

With you by my side,
I know my world is right,
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
But my love for you,
Will last an eternity through.You don't have to strive for perfection
To be loved by me
Just being yourself is all that's needed
My dear, you'll always be enough
In my eyes, you'll forever shine bright
Just the way you are, is simply right
I see your worth, in every part
Just existing, you've captured my heartI'll hold on tight to my love for you
Not just because you feel the same
But because my heart can't bear
The thought of a life without you in it
I'll never let go, my love for you will never quit
For the fear of what could have been
Keeps me holding on to you, my love will not be missed.In any tongue, the words may vary,
But the meaning stays the same, so true and unmarred.
My love for you, a constant fire,
Ever burning, no matter how far.
In Japanese, "あなたが大好きです."
In Korean, "사랑해요."
In French, "Je t'aime."
In Tagalog, "Mahal kita."
And in Spanish, "mi amore."
These words may change, but my love remains.
Forever constant, my heart claims.The frosty night is here, but you
Bring warmth that fills my heart anew
Christmas melodies, only you
My ears long to hear, it's true

My only wish, is to be near
To hold you close, to wipe away fear
With you by my side, fear takes flight
For you are the light that guides me through the night

You are my dream, my one desire
My heart's true north, my burning fire
As I lay here, under the stars
With you by my side, I'll go far

With you, my love, my heart sings
For you, it beats with love, it rings
Merry Christmas my love, my dear
With you, forever, I'll be here.My love for you will never die
Not just because you love me too
But because to say goodbye
Would hurt me more than I can do

I'll stay with you through all of time
Through happy and through troubled days
For being in your arms is sublime
And in your love, my heart finds ways

My feelings for you are true and strong
And leaving you would be so wrong
I'll hold on tight, never to let go
Of you, my love, my heart's true home

So I'll keep loving you, day by day
Forever and until the end of my days.With a smile on my face, I start each day
That you gave me, never fades away
Through the good times and the bad
It's a constant reminder of what we have had

It shines so bright, it's a guiding light
Through the darkest of days and the longest of nights
Your smile is my strength, my joy and my guide
Forever and always, it will stay by my side

So thank you dear, for the smile you gave
It's the best gift, a true treasure to save
I'll wear it always, till the end of time
With your smile, my life will forever shine.You changed the way I see the world
With eyes now open, new perspectives unfurled
Gone is the darkness, the shadows disperse
And in their place, beauty and light immerse

You opened my mind to new horizons to explore
With you by my side, I am never alone
With your touch, my heart is forever yours
With you, my world is forever changed, forever known

My world was once dull and gray
But now it's bright, with love on display
I see now, what I couldn't before
You've changed my life forevermore.Two hearts make a math equation,
Solving for love, the ultimate solution.
Add them together, as one they become,
No remainder, no fraction, just sum.
Happiness is the constant, love the gain,
The answer is clear, no need to explain.
The equation grows, with every passing day,
No division, no subtraction, just addition all the way.
Hold hands and never let go,
Together you'll always be, this you both know.
Love is the solution, the ultimate key,
To a life filled with joy, and hearts forever free.In a world of screens and endless scrolling,
I stumbled upon a love that was unfolding,
Her smile was like a beacon in the night,
A guiding light that set my heart alight.

We talked for hours, exchanging tales and laughter,
Getting to know each other, becoming one another's happily ever after,
She was witty, clever, and full of life,
And I couldn't help but feel that I was in the midst of a grand design.

She was a rose that bloomed in a digital garden,
And in her arms, I felt like I had found my pardon,
I couldn't help but fall for her,
Her laughter, her smile, her words that were a gentle purr.

I yearned to see her face to face,
To hold her hand and bask in her grace,
To look into her eyes and see her soul,
And to make our love last, through thick and thin, through the ages old.

So I took the leap, and finally met her in person,
And my heart felt like it was finally in session,
Our love continued to grow,
And I knew that she was the one I wanted to show.

She was like a shooting star that fell from the sky,
A masterpiece crafted by the hands of the divine,
She was everything I dreamed of and more,
And I couldn't be happier, I was finally sure.

That she was the one I was meant to be with,
A love that would last, through the sands of time and beyond infinity,
And as I hold her close, I feel like I'm in paradise,
With a love that will last, through the eons, until the end of all time.We are sundered by leagues and hours,
Yet our love is as resolute as fragrant flowers,
It blooms across seas and deserts and shores,
And unites us, with bonds as unyielding as ores.

We are apart, for now and perhaps forevermore,
But we cherish each other, in every conceivable form,
With tender words and messages, infused with love and delight,
We sustain our connection, steadfast and bright.

The distance is a crucible, of our love and our faith,
A trial by flame, that we brave,
But we rise to the challenge, with head held aloft,
And keep our love ablaze, like the sun on a summer's soft.

We may not be able to hold each other near,
But our hearts are intertwined, a beauteous sphere,
And we anticipate the day, when we'll be as one,
And embark on a life full of love, that has just begun.

In the interim, we treasure our memories,
Of laughter, of love, and of melodious symphonies,
And we sustain our spirits high, with the assurance,
That soon we'll be together, and bask in each other's endurances I am a poet, a lover of words,
A man with a heart that beats like birds,
A voice that whispers secrets untold,
A spirit that's pure and brave and bold.

I've searched for love in every rhyme,
In every verse and every line,
I've dreamed of you, my darling muse,
A girl with grace and beauty to choose.

You're the one who stole my heart,
Who filled my soul with poetry's art,
You're the reason I write these words,
To show my love, to sing my verse.

So listen close, and hear my voice,
The words I speak, the choices I've made,
I want to show you what I feel,
To say that I love you and I'm real.

You're the sun that lights my day,
The moon that shines upon my way,
You're the ocean's depth and grace,
The fire that burns within my space.

You're the rhythm of my life,
The muse that makes my pen come alive,
You're the reason I write,
The one I'll love, each day and night.

So take these words and hold them tight,
And know that I will love you bright,
With every word, with every line,
With every beat of my heart that's mine.I'm a man with a heart that's true,
With a love that shines bright and new,
For the one I hold dear in my sight,
The one who makes my heart take flight.

I'll walk a thousand miles just to reach,
The love that I've been searching to teach,
To show her what's in my heart,
And how much I'll love her from the start.

I'll take each step with grace and ease,
With the wind at my back and the sun in my sleeves,
I'll face the rain and the scorching heat,
With a smile on my face and two steady feet.

For she's the one who's captured my heart,
And I'll do anything to keep her from afar,
She's the one who I want to hold,
And never let go, for she's worth her weight in gold.

So I'll walk this road, with each mile I'll grow,
Stronger and braver, with love that will show,
That I'll do anything for the one I adore,
To reach her arms, where I'll forever be free to soar.

So my dear love, I'll see you soon,
With every step, my love will boom,
And I'll be there, with open arms,

From one to ten, the feelings will unfold.
A tale of love, a story untold,
A heart's journey, from winter to spring, unfold.

One: At first, just a thought, a fleeting muse,
Two: A spark of inspiration, a love to diffuse.
Three: A rhythm in the heart, a beat that's new,
Four: A melody in the mind, a love to ensue.
Five: A smile on the lips, a warm embrace,
Six: A laughter in the heart, a joy to chase.
Seven: A dream in the night, a love so true,
Eight: A wish in the heart, a love so blue.
Nine: A passion in the soul, a fire that burns,
Ten: A love in full bloom, happiness in return.
And so the poet falls in love, with a heart so bright,
A love that's pure, a love that's right.With eyes like the stars, and a smile like the sun,
She captured my heart, and now I am done.

Her beauty so pure, like a rose in bloom,
With every glance, my heart is consumed.

From the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one,
With her, my world has just begun.

I fall deeper in love with her every day,
With her by my side, I'll never stray.

She is the most beautiful woman on earth,
And my love for her will forever be worth.

With her, my life is complete,
She is my everything, my heart's true seat.

Forever and always, my love will be true,
For the most beautiful woman on earth, I'll always do.I enjoy being alone, it's true,
The peace and quiet, the calmness too,
But still, in my heart, I feel a space,
For someone dear, I long to embrace.

It's a strange feeling, this paradox I bear,
Loving my alone time, yet someone's presence I care,
Someone who knows me, in and out,
Whose presence makes my heart shout.

I value my solitude, it's true,
But with them, my heart feels anew,
Together, we share a special bond,
A love so deep, it's hard to abscond.

So I relish in my alone time,
But also treasure being with them, in the prime,
For in their company, I find,
A peace that's hard to leave behind.

In my heart, the feeling glows,
Of loving being alone, but also loving someone close.When the storm clouds gather 'round,
And problems in our relationship abound,
It's hard to find a way to cope,
To carry on, to find some hope.

But then I feel your steady hand,
Your shoulder there for me to land,
And suddenly the world's not quite so gray,
The storm may rage, but we'll find a way.

With you beside me, I can face the gale,
And weather any hardship that assail,
For in your arms, I find my peace,
And all my worries start to cease.

Your love is like a beacon bright,
Guiding me through the darkest night,
And though the storm may still rage on,
Together, we'll make it through till dawn.

So let the winds howl and the lightning flash,
We'll hold on tight, and we won't crash,
For with you by my side, I know we'll thrive,
And love will keep us strong, and alive.My love for you is like a rose,
Its petals soft and sweet,
A fragrant, delicate bloom that glows,
With a beauty that can't be beat.

It's like a river running deep,
Its currents strong and sure,
A steady flow that never sleeps,
A force that will endure.

It's like a flame that burns so bright,
With warmth and passion true,
A light that shines both day and night,
A fire that will renew.

My love for you is like the stars,
That twinkle in the night,
A spark that lights up all our hearts,
A hope that shines so bright.

It's like a song that fills the air,
With melody and grace,
A sweet refrain that's always there,
A love that can't be replaced.

My love for you is like a dream,
A vision of what could be,
A perfect world that's yet to gleam,
A place where we are free.

So take my hand and hold it tight,
And we'll explore this world,
Together, we'll make everything right,
With a love that will unfurl.

And as I hold her close, I feel like I'm in paradise,
With a love that will last, through the eons, until the end of all time.We are sundered by leagues and hours,
Yet our love is as resolute as fragrant flowers,
It blooms across seas and deserts and shores,
And unites us, with bonds as unyielding as ores.

We are apart, for now and perhaps forevermore,
But we cherish each other, in every conceivable form,
With tender words and messages, infused with love and delight,
We sustain our connection, steadfast and bright.

The distance is a crucible, of our love and our faith,
A trial by flame, that we brave,
But we rise to the challenge, with head held aloft,
And keep our love ablaze, like the sun on a summer's soft.

We may not be able to hold each other near,
But our hearts are intertwined, a beauteous sphere,
And we anticipate the day, when we'll be as one,
And embark on a life full of love, that has just begun.

In the interim, we treasure our memories,
Of laughter, of love, and of melodious symphonies,
And we sustain our spirits high, with the assurance,
That soon we'll be together, and bask in each other's endurances I am a poet, a lover of words,
A man with a heart that beats like birds,
A voice that whispers secrets untold,
A spirit that's pure and brave and bold.

I've searched for love in every rhyme,
In every verse and every line,
I've dreamed of you, my darling muse,
A girl with grace and beauty to choose.

You're the one who stole my heart,
Who filled my soul with poetry's art,
You're the reason I write these words,
To show my love, to sing my verse.

So listen close, and hear my voice,
The words I speak, the choices I've made,
I want to show you what I feel,
To say that I love you and I'm real.

You're the sun that lights my day,
The moon that shines upon my way,
You're the ocean's depth and grace,
The fire that burns within my space.

You're the rhythm of my life,
The muse that makes my pen come alive,
You're the reason I write,
The one I'll love, each day and night.

And know that I will love you bright,
With every word, with every line,
With every beat of my heart that's mine.I'm a man with a heart that's true,
With a love that shines bright and new,
For the one I hold dear in my sight,
The one who makes my heart take flight.

I'll walk a thousand miles just to reach,
The love that I've been searching to teach,
To show her what's in my heart,
And how much I'll love her from the start.

I'll take each step with grace and ease,
With the wind at my back and the sun in my sleeves,
I'll face the rain and the scorching heat,
With a smile on my face and two steady feet.

For she's the one who's captured my heart,
And I'll do anything to keep her from afar,
She's the one who I want to hold,
And never let go, for she's worth her weight in gold.

So I'll walk this road, with each mile I'll grow,
Stronger and braver, with love that will show,
That I'll do anything for the one I adore,
To reach her arms, where I'll forever be free to soar.

And so the poet falls in love, with a heart so bright,
A love that's pure, a love that's right.With eyes like the stars, and a smile like the sun,
She captured my heart, and now I am done.

Her beauty so pure, like a rose in bloom,
With every glance, my heart is consumed.

From the moment I saw her, I knew she was the one,
With her, my world has just begun.

I fall deeper in love with her every day,
With her by my side, I'll never stray.

She is the most beautiful woman on earth,
And my love for her will forever be worth.

With her, my life is complete,
She is my everything, my heart's true seat.

Forever and always, my love will be true,
For the most beautiful woman on earth, I'll always do.I enjoy being alone, it's true,
The peace and quiet, the calmness too,
But still, in my heart, I feel a space,
For someone dear, I long to embrace.

It's a strange feeling, this paradox I bear,
Loving my alone time, yet someone's presence I care,
Someone who knows me, in and out,
Whose presence makes my heart shout.

I value my solitude, it's true,
But with them, my heart feels anew,
Together, we share a special bond,
A love so deep, it's hard to abscond.

So I relish in my alone time,
But also treasure being with them, in the prime,
For in their company, I find,
A peace that's hard to leave behind.

In my heart, the feeling glows,
Of loving being alone, but also loving someone close.When the storm clouds gather 'round,
And problems in our relationship abound,
It's hard to find a way to cope,
To carry on, to find some hope.

But then I feel your steady hand,
Your shoulder there for me to land,
And suddenly the world's not quite so gray,
The storm may rage, but we'll find a way.

With you beside me, I can face the gale,
And weather any hardship that assail,
For in your arms, I find my peace,
And all my worries start to cease.

Your love is like a beacon bright,
Guiding me through the darkest night,
And though the storm may still rage on,
Together, we'll make it through till dawn.

So let the winds howl and the lightning flash,
We'll hold on tight, and we won't crash,
For with you by my side, I know we'll thrive,
And love will keep us strong, and alive.My love for you is like a rose,
Its petals soft and sweet,
A fragrant, delicate bloom that glows,
With a beauty that can't be beat.

It's like a river running deep,
Its currents strong and sure,
A steady flow that never sleeps,
A force that will endure.

It's like a flame that burns so bright,
With warmth and passion true,
A light that shines both day and night,
A fire that will renew.

My love for you is like the stars,
That twinkle in the night,
A spark that lights up all our hearts,
A hope that shines so bright.

It's like a song that fills the air,
With melody and grace,
A sweet refrain that's always there,
A love that can't be replaced.

My love for you is like a dream,
A vision of what could be,
A perfect world that's yet to gleam,
A place where we are free.

So take my hand and hold it tight,
And we'll explore this world,
Together, we'll make everything right,
With a love that will unfurl. 
In this paper, I write
Deep thoughts filled my mind.
I'm making this poem 
For the girl I love.
With her smile so bright
I mistaken it for a sunlight.
Her face is so beautiful
Even Venus got jealous.
And her gorgeous eyes
It can even outshine the starry night.
My love for her is so great
It's eight times the sun's weight.
She taught me the greatest thing
And that is how to love. 
Goes with any style
Even in simple clothes, you shine
Overflowing with love
Right here is my heart
Giggling and smiling 
Over your pretty picture 
Unconditional love is all I can give
Star of my eyes, you're my eternal light I'll never stop loving you
Not because you love me
I will keep going
Because I don't want to regret
If I let you go.You don't have to do anything
To be perfect
Just you existing
Is more than enough for me Here's a little note
For my angel
You're doing just fine
You don't have to worry
About anything Infinity wasn't just about numbers
Sometimes
It's my love for you.Just hold my hands
And we'll face everything together.Flying in my stomach
Hits me like a truck
Harder than a thunderstruck
She's my source of luck

The way her eyes bloom
It makes my heart boom
Her bright smiles and puffy cheeks
She is all I seeks

Hairs swaying like waves
To her I'm a slave
To heaven I'm ascending
She's my everything

Apple of my eye
The reason I cry
The reason I feel sky-high
She is my whole life "Gusto kita"
Nagtapat ako ng aking nadarama.
Di ko alam kung kailan o pano nagsimula.
Hindi ko rin alam kung saan magsisimula.
Akala ko kasi ay agad itong mawawala.
Ngunit hindi pala.
Kasi minahal na kita.
Hanggang sa nagtapat ka na ako'y gusto mo din pala.
Ngayon gusto na kitang makasama.
Gusto kong mahawakan ang kamay mo na sa akin ay nagpapaklma.
Matitigan ang mata mo na kumikislap kapag may liwanag na tumatama.
Nais kong paulit ulit na sabihin sayo yung salita na...
"Gusto kita" In this paper, I write
Deep thoughts of my heart,
For the girl I love so much,
Whose beauty sets my world apart.

Her smile is like the sun,
So warm and shining bright,
And her face is like a work of art,
That even Venus couldn't replicate.

Her eyes, like stars in the night,
Shine bright and mesmerize,
And my love for her is so great,
It weighs more than the sun in the skies.

She taught me the greatest lesson,
The art of love and how to give,
And for that, I'll always be grateful,
As long as I have her, I'll truly live.In simple garb you radiate,
A love that simply overflows,
My heart belongs to you alone,
With laughter and a smile that glows.

Your beauty takes my breath away,
As I gaze upon your face,
Unconditional love I give,
You're the star that guides my pace.

My eyes behold your radiant light,
Eternal, forever bright,
You're the one for whom I live,
My love for you will never blight My love for you will never cease
Not just because you feel the same
But because to let you go, I fear
Would be a regret I couldn't sustain

I'll hold on tight, with all my might
And love you till the end of time
For the thought of losing you
Brings a fear that's hard to climb

You've become a part of me
A love so deep, it's hard to explain
But know that I'll never stop loving you
Till the end of my days remain.A longing in my heart
Echoes like a drum
Each beat igniting a spark
Of desire, burning like a sun

Her beauty, a work of art
Eyes that shine, a work of magic
Her smile, like a rose, it does impart
Happiness and joy, making me manic

Her hair, like a field of wheat
Blowing in the wind, such a sight
I'm drawn to her, like a moth to heat
She's my guiding light, my guiding light

She's the apple of my eye
The love of my life, my reason why
I'll cherish and treasure her
Until the end of time, forevermore.Endless and boundless,
My love for you does run,
Like the infinite digits of pi,
It has no end, no sum.

Like the never-ending horizon,
My affection for you will never cease,
Like the vast expanse of the universe,
My love for you will never decrease.

Infinity is not just a number,
It's a feeling that's hard to define,
But when it comes to my love for you,
Infinity is the perfect sign.

With every beat of my heart,
I know that my love for you will never end,
Just like the concept of infinity,
It will only continue to expand.Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
But my love for you,
Is deeper than any hue.

Like the starry sky at night,
It shines so bright and true,
Just like the love I feel for you,
Forever strong, forever new.

From the bottom of my heart,
My feelings for you do start,
Like a garden in full bloom,
My love for you will never resume.

With you by my side,
I know my world is right,
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
But my love for you,
Will last an eternity through.You don't have to strive for perfection
To be loved by me
Just being yourself is all that's needed
My dear, you'll always be enough
In my eyes, you'll forever shine bright
Just the way you are, is simply right
I see your worth, in every part
Just existing, you've captured my heartI'll hold on tight to my love for you
Not just because you feel the same
But because my heart can't bear
The thought of a life without you in it
I'll never let go, my love for you will never quit
For the fear of what could have been
Keeps me holding on to you, my love will not be missed.In any tongue, the words may vary,
But the meaning stays the same, so true and unmarred.
My love for you, a constant fire,
Ever burning, no matter how far.
In Japanese, "あなたが大好きです."
In Korean, "사랑해요."
In French, "Je t'aime."
In Tagalog, "Mahal kita."
And in Spanish, "mi amore."
These words may change, but my love remains.
Forever constant, my heart claims.The frosty night is here, but you
Bring warmth that fills my heart anew
Christmas melodies, only you
My ears long to hear, it's true

My only wish, is to be near
To hold you close, to wipe away fear
With you by my side, fear takes flight
For you are the light that guides me through the night

You are my dream, my one desire
My heart's true north, my burning fire
As I lay here, under the stars
With you by my side, I'll go far

With you, my love, my heart sings
For you, it beats with love, it rings
Merry Christmas my love, my dear
With you, forever, I'll be here.My love for you will never die
Not just because you love me too
But because to say goodbye
Would hurt me more than I can do

I'll stay with you through all of time
Through happy and through troubled days
For being in your arms is sublime
And in your love, my heart finds ways

My feelings for you are true and strong
And leaving you would be so wrong
I'll hold on tight, never to let go
Of you, my love, my heart's true home

So I'll keep loving you, day by day
Forever and until the end of my days.With a smile on my face, I start each day
That you gave me, never fades away
Through the good times and the bad
It's a constant reminder of what we have had

It shines so bright, it's a guiding light
Through the darkest of days and the longest of nights
Your smile is my strength, my joy and my guide
Forever and always, it will stay by my side

So thank you dear, for the smile you gave
It's the best gift, a true treasure to save
I'll wear it always, till the end of time
With your smile, my life will forever shine.You changed the way I see the world
With eyes now open, new perspectives unfurled
Gone is the darkness, the shadows disperse
And in their place, beauty and light immerse

You opened my mind to new horizons to explore
With you by my side, I am never alone
With your touch, my heart is forever yours
With you, my world is forever changed, forever known

My world was once dull and gray
But now it's bright, with love on display
I see now, what I couldn't before
You've changed my life forevermore.Two hearts make a math equation,
Solving for love, the ultimate solution.
Add them together, as one they become,
No remainder, no fraction, just sum.
Happiness is the constant, love the gain,
The answer is clear, no need to explain.
The equation grows, with every passing day,
No division, no subtraction, just addition all the way.
Hold hands and never let go,
Together you'll always be, this you both know.
Love is the solution, the ultimate key,
To a life filled with joy, and hearts forever free.In a world of screens and endless scrolling,
I stumbled upon a love that was unfolding,
Her smile was like a beacon in the night,
A guiding light that set my heart alight.

We talked for hours, exchanging tales and laughter,
Getting to know each other, becoming one another's happily ever after,
She was witty, clever, and full of life,
And I couldn't help but feel that I was in the midst of a grand design.

She was a rose that bloomed in a digital garden,
And in her arms, I felt like I had found my pardon,
I couldn't help but fall for her,
Her laughter, her smile, her words that were a gentle purr.

I yearned to see her face to face,
To hold her hand and bask in her grace,
To look into her eyes and see her soul,
And to make our love last, through thick and thin, through the ages old.

So I took the leap, and finally met her in person,
And my heart felt like it was finally in session,
Our love continued to grow,
And I knew that she was the one I wanted to show.

She was like a shooting star that fell from the sky,
A masterpiece crafted by the hands of the divine,
She was everything I dreamed of and more,
And I couldn't be happier, I was finally sure.

That she was the one I was meant to be with,
A love that would last, through the sands of time and beyond infinity,
And as I hold her close, I feel like I'm in paradise,
With a love that will last, through the eons, until the end of all time.We are sundered by leagues and hours,
Yet our love is as resolute as fragrant flowers,
It blooms across seas and deserts and shores,
And unites us, with bonds as unyielding as ores.

But we cherish each other, in every conceivable form,
With tender words and messages, infused with love and delight,
We sustain our connection, steadfast and bright.

A trial by flame, that we brave,
But we rise to the challenge, with head held aloft,
And keep our love ablaze, like the sun on a summer's soft.

We may not be able to hold each other near,
But our hearts are intertwined, a beauteous sphere,
And we anticipate the day, when we'll be as one,
And embark on a life full of love, that has just begun.

In the interim, we treasure our memories,
Of laughter, of love, and of melodious symphonies,
And we sustain our spirits high, with the assurance,
That soon we'll be together, and bask in each other's endurances I am a poet, a lover of words,
A man with a heart that beats like birds,
A voice that whispers secrets untold,
